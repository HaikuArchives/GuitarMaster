Guitar Master is a Frets-on-Fire clone for Haiku.

This app is currently broken, so it can't do much,
as shown in the screenshot.
* The game should be able to read MIDI files and play them, but... that doesn't happen :(
* The game _used_ to come with its own songs, although those can't be found anywhere.
